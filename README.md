👋 Hi, I’m Carolina
- I'm  a speculative poet from Montevideo, Uruguay 🇺🇾. I've published a few books and dip my toes in whatever artform comes around
- I work in QA and am interested in learning about basically anything, but I'm currently focusing on data science-y stuff and LLM chatbots
- I love social media and am in almost all of them so reach out wherever if you want to teach or learn or share or exchange: </br>
